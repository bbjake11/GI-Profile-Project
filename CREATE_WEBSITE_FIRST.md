# 🌐 Create Website First - Step by Step

## ✅ Problem Identified:

**No website exists yet!** You need to create a website/subdomain first before you can access it.

---

## 🚀 How to Create Website:

### Step 1: Go to Domains Section

In InfinityFree Control Panel:

1. Look for **"DOMAINS"** section (in the main content area)
2. Click **"Sub Domains"** or **"Sub-Domains"**

### Step 2: Create Subdomain

1. You'll see a form to create a subdomain
2. **Enter a subdomain name:**
   - Example: `samurai-travel`
   - Or: `samurai`
   - Or: `travel`
   - **Rules**: Only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens
   - Must start with a letter

3. **Click "Create"** or **"Add Subdomain"**

### Step 3: Wait for Activation

- Usually takes **5-30 minutes**
- Status will show **"Pending"** then **"Active"**

### Step 4: Note Your Domain

After creation, you'll see:
- Your full domain: `your-subdomain.infinityfree.com`
- Or: `your-subdomain.epizy.com`
- Or: `your-subdomain.42web.io`

**Save this domain name!**

## 📋 Alternative: Check Main Domain

Looking at your Control Panel, I see:

**Main Domain:** `toptech.infinityfreeapp.com`

**You might be able to use this directly!**

Try accessing:
```
https://toptech.infinityfreeapp.com
https://toptech.infinityfreeapp.com/infinityfree-migrate.php
```

## 🎯 What to Do:

### Option 1: Create Subdomain (Recommended)

1. Go to **"DOMAINS"** → **"Sub Domains"**
2. Create a subdomain (e.g., `samurai-travel`)
3. Wait 5-30 minutes for activation
4. Use the new domain

### Option 2: Use Main Domain

Try using your main domain:
```
https://toptech.infinityfreeapp.com
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes:

1. **Files are already uploaded** to `/htdocs/` ✅
2. **You just need a domain** to access them
3. **Create subdomain** OR **use main domain**

---

## 🔍 Quick Check:

**In Control Panel, look for:**

1. **"DOMAINS"** section
2. **"Sub Domains"** link
3. Click it and create a subdomain

**OR**

Try accessing your main domain:
```
https://toptech.infinityfreeapp.com/infinityfree-migrate.php
```

---

## 📝 Next Steps:

1. **Create a subdomain** (if you want a custom name)
   - OR
2. **Try main domain** (`toptech.infinityfreeapp.com`)

Once you have a domain, you can access:
- `https://your-domain/infinityfree-migrate.php`
- `https://your-domain` (your website)

---

## 💡 Recommendation:

**Try the main domain first:**
```
https://toptech.infinityfreeapp.com/infinityfree-migrate.php
```

If that works, you're done! If not, create a subdomain.
